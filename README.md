# Weather_App
A weather app fetching data from OpenWeatherMap API.

The weather app enables users to input a city name in a search bar. Upon entering the city name, the application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it to the user. The displayed information includes the current temperature, city name, weather icon, wind speed, humidity, and feels-like temperature.

Additionally, the application supports features such as debounced search to avoid unnecessary API calls, storing the last searched location in the browser's local storage for future visits, and the ability to switch between the search form and weather display.

Potential future enhancements mentioned in the comments include adding geolocation functionality to automatically detect the user's location and implementing customizable themes.
